                  Bitcoin is a revolutionary currency and consensus network that enables a new payment system using
                  digital money.
                  It is the first cryptocurrency or decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its
                  users with
                  no central authority or middlemen. From an economist perspective, it is a more perfect and
                  programmable version
                  of fiat money. Fiat money is prone to human mismanagement and inflation by excess money printing,
                  thus depreciating
                  in value over time. Bitcoin’s solves this problem as its supply is limited by code to mint 21 million
                  coins for its
                  existence. Bitcoin is one of the first mathematically created currencies.
                  From a user perspective, bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.

                  Cryptocurrency is a new form of digital money for the internet age first created after the financial
                  crisis in
                  2008/2009. Think of it as the currency of the internet. It is a natural evolution of money that
                  enables the freer
                  flow of money around the world. Cryptocurrency does not recognise national borders and is more
                  frictionless than cash money. Benefits of cryptocurrency include speedier transactions of currency
                  and value across the world (send crypto to your crypto address in Italy from Australia within 10
                  minutes for only a few cents instead of paying transaction fees of 5% plus with traditional payments
                  systems. Speedier transactions and less middlemen taking their cut are some of the attractive
                  benefits of cryptocurrency versus traditional currency.

                  The block chain is a uniquely architected database for digital
                  transactions. To break it down— a block contains a record of new transactions and
                  once that block is full, it is added to a chain of other blocks of transactions;
                  hence the name “block chain”. This information is publicly viewable on an explorer,
                  where eventually each transaction is approved or rejected by a network of computers
                  (called miners). The block chain is considered immutable (meaning unchanging)
                  because in order to alter a block, all previous blocks would have to also be altered.
                  The vast majority of the community would have to agree on the change and be willing
                  to update all subsequent blocks. Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment
